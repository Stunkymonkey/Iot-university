# CrOwS - Crowd Overwatch System

Due to the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many daily tasks come with the risk of becoming infected or infecting others.
We have built a smart supermarket, which should minimize the risk of being infected with the corona virus.
Since it can be dangerous to be in large crowds, it is important to limit the number of people in the supermarket and at the same time keep waiting times to a minimum for comfort.
Furthermore, the employees should be protected as well as possible and a good air quality must be ensured. 
While current markets have rather improvised solutions, a smart building that protects the privacy of the customer would be better to not only increase safety for customers but also employees. 
Therefore, we have built a prototype that helps to handle the requirements more easily. 
In this work, we describe how our system is constructed, which requirements are fulfilled and how this was implemented.
